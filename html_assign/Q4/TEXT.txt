Tag and Element in HTML

Tag:
A tag is a component of HTML that defines the start and end of an element.
 Tags are enclosed in angle brackets ('<' and '>'). Most tags come in pairs: an
  opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag denotes the beginning of an 
  element, and the closing tag (which includes a forward slash '/' before the 
  tag name) denotes the end of the element.

  Example of tags 
  <h1>  </h1>

1. '<h1>' is the opening tag for a heading element.
2. '</h1>' is the closing tag for the heading element.

Element:
An element in HTML is a complete structure that includes the opening tag, 
content (if any), and the closing tag. Elements represent the content and 
structure of the web page.

Example of an Element:
<h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>

In this example:

1.'<h1>' is the opening tag.
2. Welcome to My Web Page is the content.
3. '</h1>' is the closing tag.
4. Together, these form an '<h1>' element, which defines a heading on the web page.
