<!-- Comments in HTML are used to include notes or explanations within the code that are not displayed in the browser. They are helpful for developers to understand the structure of the code, keep track of important details, or leave reminders for future updates. Comments can also be used to temporarily disable code without deleting it.

Syntax for Comments in HTML
To write a comment in HTML, you enclose the comment text within "<!--" and "-->".

<!-- Example of Using Comments in an HTML Document
Here is an example of how to use comments in an HTML document:  -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
    <!-- This is a comment explaining that the title of the page is set -->
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <!-- This section contains the main heading of the page -->

    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my web page.</p>
    <!-- This comment is a note about the paragraph above -->

    <!-- The following section is currently under construction -->
    <!-- <div>
        <h2>Under Construction</h2>
        <p>More content coming soon!</p>
    </div> -->
</body>
</html>

<!-- In this example:

The first comment explains the purpose of the <title> tag.
The second comment describes the main heading.
The third comment explains the paragraph content.
The last set of comments is used to temporarily disable a section of the HTML that is under construction. -->
