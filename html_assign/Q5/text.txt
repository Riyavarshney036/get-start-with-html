 The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is an instruction to the web browser about what version
  of HTML the page is written in. It helps the browser to render the page correctly. 
  The DOCTYPE declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction and must appear at
   the very top of the HTML document, before the <html> tag.

Purpose of the DOCTYPE Declaration:

Specify the HTML Version: It informs the browser about the version of HTML used, 
ensuring proper rendering.

Trigger Standards Mode: It triggers the standards mode in browsers, which ensures
 that the page is rendered according to web standards. Without the DOCTYPE
  declaration, browsers may switch to quirks mode, which attempts to emulate older,
   non-standard behavior for backward compatibility.

Syntax for the DOCTYPE Declaration:
For HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration is simple and looks like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>
